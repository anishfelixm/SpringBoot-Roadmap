## Java JDK and JVM

JDK stands for Java Development Kit. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It compiles the Java source code (.java files) to a bytecode format (.class format). This bytecode is run on the JDK which hosts the JVM. JVM is cross platform i.e. doesn't depend on the system while the JDK will be machine specific. So Java code will be same irrespective of machine and its the job of JDK to run the bytecode in a way that works on the system.
