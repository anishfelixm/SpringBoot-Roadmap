## Classes and Objects

A Class is a template for creating objects. It has all properties and methods required for that Object to exist. An Object is an instance of a class and it contains attributes and methods.
A constructor is a special methood thhat's called when an object is instantiated. This gives us the liberty to create custom objects.
